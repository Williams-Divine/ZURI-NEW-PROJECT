            <p>I am super grateful for this opportunity to be part of the program. The sleepless, foodless and stressful days and nights were all worth it. Zuri is doing great, and I hope to be part of this wonder and innovative movement to empower young Africans to take over the world. I once tweeted that 'Zuri will shock the world' …and I mean it because it is true!

I say this because I had tried studying on my own for months with not much progress, but coming across this training gave me a good feel of what this area of life truly entails.
